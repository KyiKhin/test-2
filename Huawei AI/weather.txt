March – May (Summer)

The whole country can be hot (especially in the afternoon – around 35 degrees Celsius) so you’re advised to plan sightseeing more in the mornings and evenings. The landscapes are drier but the days are dry (expect some rainier days in late May). This is an excellent time to visit the beaches and to visit higher parts of Myanmar, which are cooler (including The Shan state). 
Mid-October – February (Winter)

This is the most popular season for tourists to travel because of the lower temperatures (evenings in the mountains can be cold –10 degrees Celsius) but the daytime temperature around most of the country is about 30 degrees. Traditionally November marks the beginning of the dry season (although November 2013 saw more rainy days then July or August of that year). Weather wise this is the perfect time to visit everywhere in the country (but bring warm clothes for Inle Lake and higher areas). The downfall is that it can be busy at the major tourist locations – it is much harder to find yourself ‘away from the crowds’ no matter how carefully we plan your itinerary.

June – mid-October (Green Season)

The temperatures drop as the rain arrives (although still about 25 – 30 degrees Celsius) and the scenery is wonderfully green. Sightseeing is not too hot and not too dusty. It is the perfect period to visit Bagan,

Mandalay and Shan states (Hsipaw, Kyaukme, Pyin Oo Lwin, Kalaw, Inle Lake), which sees much less rain than the rest of the country (mostly a short shower at the end of the day). We would encourage you to avoid the beaches in this period (it rains more at the coast and most hotels are closed in this period). Yangon can get quite some rain as well so it is better to spend just one or two nights here. Sightseeing is great as there aren’t many other tourists around yet – it’s Myanmar at its best! This is the period we generally advise our closest friends to come and visit.
